# Validation Gates

Run these after creating or refactoring a skill. Fix failures before declaring done.

## Gate 1 — Structure
- `SKILL.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`.
- Frontmatter has `name` (matches the directory, lowercase-hyphen, ≤64) and `description` (≤1024, non-empty).
- Every file referenced in the body actually exists (no dead pointers).
```bash
ls -R .claude/skills/<name>
grep -nE '`(references|templates|scripts|assets)/' .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
```

## Gate 2 — Description quality (the trigger)
- Third person; not "Use this when you…".
- States WHAT it does AND WHEN to use it.
- Contains literal trigger phrases a user would actually say, plus the `/name` invocation.

## Gate 3 — Body style & size
- Imperative / infinitive voice throughout; no second person ("you should").
- The body is the decision spine + pointers, not a data dump.
- Target 1,500–2,000 words; investigate anything over ~5k.

## Gate 4 — Progressive disclosure
- Bulky / occasionally-needed / output-shaped detail lives in `references/` or `templates/` (or is cited by
  path/URL, or gathered at runtime) — not inlined.
- No content duplicated between body and resources.
- Always-needed output formats have a **mandatory-read** pointer; sometimes-needed detail has a lazy pointer.
- References are one level deep and all linked from a Resources section.

## Gate 5 — Change verification (any edit to an existing skill — non-negotiable)

Skip this gate only when the skill was created from scratch this session.

**5a. The change is real.** Re-run the case the author named in the adapt interview ("how will we know it
worked?") and confirm the specific new behavior happens. For a **retarget**, verify in a **fresh session** —
leftover context from the editing session masks a description that doesn't actually trigger.

**5b. Nothing else broke.** The behaviors the skill already got right still work. Over-reach is the #1 adapt
failure, and this is where it gets caught.

**5c. Split-and-trim only — behavior preservation.** The trimmed skill + resources drives the SAME process and
SAME output as the original. At every point the original inlined content, the body now reaches the right pointer
at the right time. Nothing dropped, nothing duplicated. When uncertain, keep content in the body.

## Gate 6 — Independent review
Run the `code-reviewer` agent (or Claude Code's native `skill-reviewer`, if available) over the new skill for a
fresh-eyes check of description quality, organization, and progressive disclosure. Apply its high-confidence
findings; ignore noise.

## Gate 7 — Trigger test, then exercise for real
- **User invocation:** confirm `/<name>` appears and runs.
- **Agent invocation:** describe a task in the skill's domain (using one of the trigger phrases) and confirm the
  skill auto-loads. If it doesn't, strengthen the `description` triggers and retry.
- **Exercise it end-to-end on real work** — don't stop at "it loaded." A real run surfaces bugs a load-check never
  will. Fold what you learn back in.

## Done
All gates pass. For any edit to an existing skill, **Gate 5 is non-negotiable** — an unverified change is a guess,
and a split-and-trim that changes output is a regression.
