# Skills Create: the meta-skill

A skill that authors and improves skills. Two jobs:

- **Create** a new skill from scratch (or port an existing prompt / command file).
- **Adapt** an existing skill so it works *your* way: retarget its triggering, localize its commands, encode your
  conventions, add an interview, compose subagents or CLIs, shape its output, or split a fat body into references.

Most real work is **adapt**. A skill is rarely wrong on its first day; it drifts as the project moves, or it
arrives generic from a pack and has to be made yours. Treat adapting as the main road, not a cleanup chore.

**It's built the way it teaches:** a lean body that defers detail to `references/`. That's progressive disclosure
(the V19 lesson), and this skill is its own worked example. **It's all composable markdown:** a skill is a
`SKILL.md` plus optional files the agent loads only when it reaches for them.

## Prescribe the craft, not the content

Be **strict on how a skill is built** and **agnostic on what any given skill, or its output, should contain.**

- **Prescribe (firm, universal):** progressive disclosure, a third-person trigger-rich `description`, an
  imperative lean body, no duplication, every bundled file wired, deliberate invocation control, validation that
  fits the skill type. (See `references/skill-standards.md`.)
- **Do NOT prescribe (the author's call):** the sections a plan / PRD / report should have, the domain vocabulary,
  the output shape, which phases exist. There is no canonical output. Guide the author to a good decision, never
  hand them a fixed one.

Strict on the craft so the author stays free on the content. *(This is the course's "guide, don't prescribe", and
take-vs-build: you **build** a skill when you own the process and want it to follow YOUR way.)*

## Classify the skill first

Pin the **type** before applying the craft, in either mode. The guidance is proportional, not one-size-fits-all:

| Type | What it is | Apply |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflow** | a multi-step procedure (plan, review, ship) | the full lens incl. verifiable validation gates |
| **Artifact-generator** | produces a document/output | Context-is-King + a *suggested* (never mandated) output shape |
| **Knowledge / reference** | facts the agent consults | Context-is-King + information-dense; **no** phases, **no** validation loop |
| **Tool-wrapper** | drives a script / CLI / API | a deterministic script + sharp triggers; validation = the tool's own exit code |

A skill can blend types, so apply the union of what fits. Never force a workflow's machinery (phases, loops,
output skeletons) onto a knowledge skill. Full detail: `references/skill-standards.md` -> Skill types.

## Step 0: route the request

Read **`$ARGUMENTS`** and decide which job this is. Infer it; only ask when genuinely ambiguous.

| The request | Mode | Follow |
|---|---|---|
| a capability that doesn't exist yet ("a skill that...", "turn this prompt into a skill", `create <name>`) | **Create** | `references/creating-skills.md` |
| anything aimed at a skill that already exists: names one, points at a path, describes a change, reports a misbehavior, or says `refactor <path>` | **Adapt** | `references/adapting-skills.md` |
| genuinely unclear | ask **one** question: a new skill, or a change to one you already have? | |

**Resolve the target before working.** In Adapt mode, locate the actual `SKILL.md` (search `.claude/skills/` and
`~/.claude/skills/`). If the name is a near-miss or matches several, confirm which skill is meant. Never guess at
the target: editing the wrong skill is worse than asking.

Both modes obey the same craft rules, so read `references/skill-standards.md` first.

## Create: quick spine (full detail: `references/creating-skills.md`)

1. **Gather context** - the literal phrases that should trigger it, the task start to finish, the gotchas, the
   patterns to mirror. Ask the user; don't write yet.
2. **Plan the resources** - what repeats -> `scripts/`; what informs the work -> `references/`; what shapes the
   output -> `templates/`; what you don't own or what changes upstream -> cite a path/URL; what only exists at
   runtime -> gather it (ask the user, read git/codebase).
3. **Scaffold** - copy `templates/SKILL.template.md` to `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; add `references/` and
   `templates/` only as the plan needs.
4. **Write the spine first** - third-person trigger-rich `description`, imperative lean body, detail pushed to
   references. Get it *triggering* before you write the references.
5. **Validate and iterate** - `references/validation.md` (checklist -> trigger test -> run it for real).

## Adapt: quick spine (full detail: `references/adapting-skills.md`)

1. **Read the target and keep a baseline.** Read the whole `SKILL.md` and its bundled files before proposing
   anything. Preserve the original so the change can be compared and reverted: a git commit if the repo is clean,
   otherwise a copy alongside it.
2. **Interview.** Do not start editing from a one-line ask. Ask the four questions below.
3. **Route to a change pattern** using the table. Name the pattern out loud so the author knows what is changing
   and why.
4. **Make the smallest change that does it.** Edit in place, and preserve everything the author didn't ask to
   change. If the skill genuinely needs a rewrite, say so and get agreement before starting one.
5. **Verify the change is real** against the case from question 4, then run `references/validation.md`.

### The interview (ask these, in this order)

1. **What happened, or what's missing?** Get the concrete case: the run where it went wrong, or the thing it
   never does. "Show me the last time it disappointed you" beats any abstract answer.
2. **What should it have done instead?** This is *their* way, the part only they know. Push for specifics: the
   actual command, the actual convention, the actual question it should have asked first.
3. **Always, or just this once?** A rule the skill should always follow belongs in the skill. A one-off belongs
   in the prompt. Not every correction earns a permanent line.
4. **How will we know it worked?** The case to re-run at step 5. Without this there is no verification, only hope.

Ask only what's missing. If `$ARGUMENTS` already answers a question, skip it and say so.

### Change patterns (route the interview's answers here)

| The symptom | Pattern | Where the change lands |
|---|---|---|
| never fires, or fires on the wrong requests | **Retarget** | `description` / `when_to_use` / invocation flags |
| runs commands that don't exist in this project | **Localize** | body: real commands, real paths, real working directory |
| ignores how this team actually does things | **Encode conventions** | body: an explicit constraints section |
| guesses instead of asking the calls that matter | **Add an interview** | body: a question gate before it commits |
| explores inline, or ignores a tool it should drive | **Compose** | body: dispatch subagents, a CLI, or an MCP tool |
| right process, wrong shaped output | **Shape the output** | `templates/` + a mandatory-read line |
| body is long and most of it is rarely needed | **Split and trim** | `references/` (see `references/refactoring-skills.md`) |

Patterns combine. Apply the ones the interview actually surfaced, and no more.

> **The #1 adapt risk: rewriting more than was asked.** The author knows this skill and chose most of what's in
> it. Silent changes to the parts they were happy with destroy their trust faster than the original flaw did.
> Change what the interview justified, leave the rest, and report exactly what moved.

## When to build, and when to adapt

Build a new skill when you **own a process** and want the agent to follow *your* way of it, repeatedly: the
take-vs-build rule from V19. A rough threshold is the Rule of Three, so once you've prompted the same thing about
three times, bank it. Don't build for a one-off, or for a tool whose owner already ships a good skill.

**Prefer adapting to creating when something close already exists.** A pack skill that is eighty percent right and
already wired into a loop is worth more than a new skill that is perfect and wired into nothing. Create a rival
only when the capability is genuinely different, never just because the existing one is generic: generic is the
starting point you adapt. Two skills competing for the same trigger is worse than one imperfect skill.
