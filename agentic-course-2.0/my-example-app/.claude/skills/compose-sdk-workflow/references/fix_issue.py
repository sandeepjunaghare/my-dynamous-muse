fix_issue.py — ONE stage of V27's fix loop, translated to the Agent SDK.

The dependencies live in the header above (PEP 723): one file, no venv,
no install step — `uv run fix_issue.py 42` anywhere uv exists. `rich` is
in that same header for exactly one reason: readable terminal output
costs one more line here, not a project setup.

Three things a shell script cannot have:
  1. the session is an OBJECT — the client below IS the implementer's context
  2. your .claude/ layer loads automatically
  3. guard() is asked about tool calls AS THEY HAPPEN, and can say no

Deliberately unchanged: the checks stay a subprocess. Either they exit 0
or they don't. A better harness never absorbs your checks.
