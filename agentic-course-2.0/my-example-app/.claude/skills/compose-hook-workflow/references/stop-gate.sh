# The mechanism is the same one pre_tool_use.py uses: **exit 2 blocks**.
# Per the hooks docs, exit 2 on a Stop event "prevents Claude from stopping"
# and continues the conversation, and the blocking reason is read from stderr.
# Note the translation: your checkers exit 1 on failure, and exit 1 does NOT
# block — only exit 2 does. Converting one to the other is the whole job.

# `stop_hook_active` is true whenever this Stop was itself triggered by a
# previous block — but it is a boolean, not a count, and it goes true on the
# very FIRST retry and stays true after. Treating "active" as "let it through"
# (an earlier version of this script did) means the gate blocks exactly once
# per session and then waves through every retry after, checks red or not —
# verified live: a session that never touched a file was still allowed to
# finish with a failing test sitting in the tree. The harness gives no count
# to bound on, so — same as everywhere else in this phase — the script bounds
# itself: a small per-session counter on disk, the same shape as baton.sh's
# in-flight marker, because a hook has no memory and has to read state.
