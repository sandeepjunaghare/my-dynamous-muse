PostToolUse hook — the visibility pillar.

Fires AFTER every tool call. It can't block (the tool already ran), so its job is
to *observe*: append the full event to logs/post_tool_use.json. The result is a
complete audit trail of exactly what the agent did — every command, every edit —
that you can read back or pipe into a dashboard.

Pre = gate. Post = log.

Fails OPEN: any error exits 0, so logging can never break your session.

MAKE IT YOURS: this is the simplest useful PostToolUse hook. The common upgrades
are auto-formatting a file the moment it's edited, or notifying you on a specific
tool. Run the `hooks-create` skill and describe what you want.
