"""
PreToolUse hook — the deterministic guardrail.

Fires BEFORE every matched tool call. It inspects what the agent is about to do
and, if the call crosses a line you never want crossed, blocks it: print the
reason to stderr and exit(2). Claude Code stops the tool and hands the reason
back to the agent, so it adapts instead of doing the thing.

Two guarantees ship here:
  1. The agent can never reach your secrets — not the env file, not the other
     credential files (ssh keys, .pem, .aws, .netrc, credentials.json), and not
     by dumping the process environment. Committed `.env.example` is allowed.
  2. The agent can never run a destructive `rm -rf`.

Everything else is allowed (exit 0). The hook FAILS OPEN: any unexpected error
exits 0, so a bug in this script can never brick your session.

MAKE IT YOURS: the two `is_*` functions below are the entire policy. Add your own
(protected paths, prod config, lockfiles, migrations), or run the `hooks-create`
skill and describe the guarantee you want in plain English.

A note on coverage: the hook is GUARANTEED to run — what it CATCHES is only as
good as the checks below. This blocks the obvious routes, not every conceivable
one. The hook is the enforcement point; you still own the coverage.
